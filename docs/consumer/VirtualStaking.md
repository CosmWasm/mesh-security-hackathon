# Meta Staking

(**TODO** better naming)

Meta Staking is a permissioned contract on the Consumer side that can interact with the
native staking module in special ways. It manages an allow list of authorized Receivers
and is responsible for converting their "virtual stake" into actual stake, as well
as providing them with their share of the rewards.

**TODO** more details
