# Development Roadmap

Created: Apr 17, 2023

## High Level Milestones

### MVP

Target Date: June/July 2023

The first milestone will be design containing all major features in a solid foundation to build on.
It is designed to be launched on two testnets along with a usable UI, so we can begin getting real
feedback from users and relayers, while building out the more complex features and polishing off some
tougher issues.

### V1

Target date: Early Q4 2023 ??

This will include a feature complete version of all code (eg including slashing), but may not have all
extensions (such as remote staking not providing gov voting power). The provider side should
be well reviewed and free from any security holes (safe to deploy on larger chains). The consumer side
(which includes a custom SDK module) will be as solid as possible, but not recommended to run on serious
chains. At this points, Osmosis could provide security to a small market cap chain.

### V2

Target date: Early Q1 2024 ??

This will include all optional features we consider feasible in a realistic time frame and most importantly
will have much deeper security model, and have received some external reviews (maybe audit if someone pays).
This should be stable enough such that chains with solid market caps could provide peer security (being both
provider and consumer).
